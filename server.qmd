#### How to get access

Send an email to Mr. [Raviraj Sukhadiya](raviraj.s@iitgn.ac.in), keeping Prof. [Nipun Batra](nipun.batra@iitgn.ac.in) in cc. Mention the following details in your request: i) server name; ii) purpose for access.

#### Don'ts
- Do not use the server for personal use or anything not related to the project. This includes any classwork or homework.
- Do not share your server credentials with anyone else.

#### Fair usage
- Sometimes we have multiple projects running on the same server. Please be considerate of other projects and do not use up all the resources.
- Sometimes we may allocate specific cores or GPUs to specific projects. Please do not use cores or GPUs that are not allocated to your project.
